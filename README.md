                                 n=-1, so that the deposits that are younger than 1 day

   on the path, e.g. 
   
        ln -s /usr/local/easy-manage-deposit-<version>/bin/easy-manage-deposit /usr/bin



General configuration settings can be set in `cfg/application.properties` and logging can be configured
